Number Converter
------------------------

Number Converter is, as its name very explicitly describes it, a number converter. It can convert binary, decimal or hexadecimal numbers to binary, decimal and hexadecimal.

 The base of the original number is detected automatically but can be set manually; This is relevent for numbers like 10 that are treated as binary by default.
